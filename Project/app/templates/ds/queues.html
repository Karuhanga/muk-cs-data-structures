					<h5>Queues</h5>
				</div>
				<p>
				A queue is a list from which elements are deleted from one end of the structure, called the front
				(this operation is called dequeue), and new elements are added to the other end, called the rear
				(this operation iscalled enqueue). Consequently, a queue operates in a “first-in–first-out” (FIFO)
				fashion—akin to a queue of customers served by a single teller in a bank. Queues
				also have many important applications, including several algorithms for graph problems.

					<h5>Main Applications</h5>
				</div>

				<p>
					Queues are a useful representation of problems for different applications.
					 For example, jobs to a network printer is enqueued so that the earlier a job is submitted the earlier it will be printed. Breadth first searches use queues.
					 When a resource is shared among multiple consumers. Examples include CPU scheduling, Disk Scheduling.
					 When data is transferred asynchronously (data not necessarily received at same rate as sent) between two processes. Examples include IO Buffers, pipes, file IO, etc.
					 In real life scenario, Call Center phone systems uses Queues to hold people calling them in an order, until a service representative is free.

					<h5>Advantages</h5>
				</div>

				<p>
				Data queues are a fast method of inter-process communication. Data queues free up jobs from performing some work, which can lead to a better response time and an overall improvement in system performance.
				Data queues serve as the fastest form of asynchronous communication between two different tasks.The main advantages is that adding or removing elements can be done quickly and efficiently. Queues are helpful when multiple consumers share a particular process, for example, a website might only have so much space to allow consumers to download a particular file.</p>

					<h5>Drawbacks</h5>
				</div>

				<p>The main disadvantages is that a queue is not readily searchable and adding or removing elements from the middle of the queue is very complex.
					Queues are very democratic in that the first item in the queue gets processed first - FIFO. This is NOT what is wanted in all cases, for example in emergency departments of a hospital.
					In queues there is a fixed entry point and a fixed exit point and since structures are heavily used in sorting, searching and indexing these kind of restriction increases the time and space requirements of the algorithm.
					ultimately the program will be less efficient and slow.
