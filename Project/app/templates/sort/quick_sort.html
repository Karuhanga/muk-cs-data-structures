					<h5>Quick Sort</h5>
				</div>
				<p>
					The quick sort works on the divide-and-conquer principle. First, it partitions the list of items into two
					sublists based on a pivot element. All elements in the first sublist are arranged to be smaller than the pivot,
					 while all elements in the second sublist are arranged to be larger than the pivot. The same partitioning
					 and arranging process is performed repeatedly on the resulting sublists until the whole list of items are sorted.

					<h5>Main Applications</h5>
				</div>
				<p>
					Traditionally built-in for many runtimes, hence used by programs that call the default. Canâ€™t be used where
					worst-case behavior could be exploited or cause significant ramifications, such as services
					 that might receive denial-of-service attacks, or real-time systems. Quick3 or Randomized variants
					 avoid worst-case.

					<h5>Advantages</h5>
				</div>
				<p>
					The quick sort is regarded as the best sorting algorithm. This is because of its significant advantage in terms
					of efficiency because it is able to deal well with a huge list of items. Because it sorts in place, no additional storage is required as
					 well.

					<h5>Drawbacks</h5>
				</div>
				<p>
					The slight disadvantage of quick sort is that its worst-case
					performance is similar to average performances of the bubble, insertion or selections sorts.
